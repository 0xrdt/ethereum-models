      This table contains block level data for the Ethereum Blockchain. This table can be used to analyze trends at a block level, for example gas fees vs. total transactions over time.

        description: The blockchain on which transactions are being confirmed.
      - name: TX_COUNT
        description: Total number of transactions within a block.
      - name: DIFFICULTY
        description: The effort required to mine the block.
      - name: TOTAL_DIFFICULTY
        description: Total difficulty of the chain at a given block. 
      - name: EXTRA_DATA
        description: Any data included by the miner for a given block.
      - name: GAS_LIMIT
        description: Total gas limit provided by all transactions in the block.
      - name: GAS_USED
        description: Total gas used in the block.
      - name: HASH
        description: The hash of the block header for a given block.
      - name: PARENT_HASH
        description: The hash of the block from which a given block is generated. Also known as the parent block. 
      - name: MINER
        description: Miner who successfully added a given block to the blockchain. 
      - name: NONCE
        description: Block nonce is a value used during mining to demonstrate proof of work for a given block.
      - name: RECEIPTS_ROOT
        description: The root of the state trie.
      - name: SHA3_UNCLES
        description: The mechanism which Ethereum Javascript RLP encodes an empty string.
      - name: SIZE
        description: Block size, which is determined by a given block's gas limit. 
      - name: UNCLE_BLOCKS
        description: > 
          Uncle blocks occur when two blocks are mined and broadcasted at the same time, 
          with the same block number. The block validated across the most nodes will be added to the primary chain,
          and the other one becomes an uncle block. Miners do receive rewards for uncle blocks.

        description: This JSON column contains the block header details.
